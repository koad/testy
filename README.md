# Testy the Discord Example Bot

After a few nights of having dreams about the damn discord bot i was working on, i came up with this framework for it.

Beware of bugs,  PRs are apprecaited.





---

* Make a directory for your app data, copy the example-config.js file from this repo to it, then from inside of it
```
mv sample-config.js config.js && mkdir commands && mkdir utilities
```

* Open up ``config.js`` in your favorite editor and edit the values to reflect your machine/situation




* Then to run the bot from the repo.
```
DATADIR=/home/koad/.sample-datadir/ node index.js
```
